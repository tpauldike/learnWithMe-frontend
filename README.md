It is a simple web app that makes it easier for one to practice building an app from start to finish. It's purpose is very obvious and it is user friendly.

## Technologies
The following programming languages were used alongside other necessary tools:
- **Front end**
    - `HTML`
    - `CSS`
    - `JavaScript`
- **Back end**
  - `NestJs` as the backend framework with several other tools and libraries
  - `PostgreSQL` for the database
The backend work is hosted the GitHub repository, [learnWithMe-backend](https://github.com/tpauldike/learnWithMe-backend)

## Usage
All you need to do is to visit the website and fill the form, and you'll get a feedback, if your application is accepted and if your email is correct and working. The admin paniel actually has more functionalities, actually, but it's not for the public ðŸ˜Š
